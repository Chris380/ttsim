Turing Tumble Simulator
=======================

This is a software simulator of the [Turing Tumble](https://www.turingtumble.com/),
a programmable marble-powered computer. It runs entirely in your browser, so 
you can [try it out here](https://jessecrossen.github.io/ttsim/). If you've used 
an actual Turing Tumble, it should be straightforward to get started, but here's
[some documentation about how to use it](https://jessecrossen.github.io/ttsim/usage.md).
