How to use the Turing Tumble Simulator
======================================

The simulator runs right in your browser, so there's nothing to install. It also saves its state to the URL, so you can bookmark a board or share the URL and it should bring back the interface just like it was, except that all the balls will be returned to the top. You can also save the configuration of the board to a file and restore it, see the entries for the upload and download tools below. Note that even though the information in the URL is compressed, it can get really long, so you may want to use a URL shortening service before sharing. The simulator always launches with a standard board that mimics the layout of a real Turing Tumble, but you can change it as much as you want by selecting tools from the toolbars on either side of the window.

Tools
-----

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description
---------------------------------------------------- | :----------
<img src="images/usage/hand.png"/> | The hand tool allows you to manipulate things. Some parts can be flipped or rotated by clicking on them, and you can also drag parts and balls to different locations. Other parts like drops and turnstiles have special actions that happen when you click or drag the center. See the entries on those parts for details. Hold down control and drag to pan the view around, or just drag an empty part of the board. You can also resize the board by grabbing it by the edges.
<img src="images/usage/PartLocation-t.png"/> | The **erase tool** removes parts from the board. Click on a part to remove it. Start on a part and drag to remove many parts at once. Click on a spot without a part to turn it into a blank square (with no pin in the middle), and click again to restore the pin.
<img src="images/usage/Ramp-t.png"/> | The **ramp tool** adds a ramp part to the board. Ramps accept balls from both directions, but only direct them in one specific direction. By default the ramp tool places ramps that point right, but you can switch this by selecting the ramp tool and clicking the button again. The part in the toolbar will flip, and ramps you add to the board will now point left. You can switch back and forth as much as you want by clicking the ramp button while it's selected. You can also place ramps on the board in any direction and flip them later using the hand tool. You can drag across the board with the ramp tool to place a lot of ramps at once. Clicking on a ramp that's already pointing in the same direction will remove it.
<img src="images/usage/Crossover-t.png"/> | The **crossover tool** adds a crossover part to the board. A crossover accepts a balls from either side and directs it to the opposite side.
<img src="images/usage/Interceptor-t.png"/> | The **interceptor tool** adds an interceptor part to the board. An interceptor catches balls from either side and stops them from moving further down the board.
<img src="images/usage/Bit-t.png"/> | The **bit tool** adds a bit part to the board. A bit accepts balls from either side and directs them to one side, just like a ramp. But as it does this, it switches so that it will direct the next ball to the other side. Just like with the ramp tool, you can switch the direction of the bits your placing by clicking the tool while it's already selected. You can also place bits on the board and flip them later with the hand tool.
<img src="images/usage/Gearbit-t.png"/> | The **gearbit tool** adds a gearbit part to the board. Gearbits work just like bits except that you can connect them together with gears. All connected gearbits will always point the same way.
<img src="images/usage/Gear-t.png"/> | The **gear tool** adds a gear part to the board. Gears don't interact with balls, all they do is connect gears together. Unlike all the parts above, gears can be placed on any square of the grid.
<img src="images/usage/Ball-m.png"/> | The **ball tool** allows you to add and remove balls. Clicking in a place on the board without a ball will add one, and clicking on a place where there is a ball will remove it. Whenever you create a ball, it gets assigned the color of the nearest drop (see below). If you hover with the ball tool over a drop, you'll see a number that counts the number of balls currently in the drop. It does not count any balls that are below the bottom of the drop.
