How to use the Turing Tumble Simulator
======================================

<img src="images/usage/hand.png" align="left"/> The hand tool allows you to manipulate things. Some parts can be flipped or rotated by clicking on them, and you can also drag parts and balls to different locations. Other parts like drops and turnstiles have special actions that happen when you click or drag the center. See the entries on those parts for details. Hold down control and drag to pan the view around, or just drag an empty part of the board. You can also resize the board by grabbing it by the edges.

<img src="images/usage/PartLocation-t.png" align="left"/> The erase tool removes parts from the board. Click on a part to remove it. Start on a part and drag to remove many parts at once. Click on a spot without a part to turn it into a blank square (with no pin in the middle), and click again to restore the pin.
